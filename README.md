Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming [see-more](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp)

## Python (OOPs)

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

**It is used for**

- web development (server-side),
- software development,
- mathematics,
- system scripting.

## Python Install

Many PCs and Macs will have Python already installed.
To check if you have Python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):

```diff
python --version
```

## The Python Command Line

```diff
C:\Users\Your Name>python
```

Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py"

```diff
C:\Users\Your Name>py
```

From there you can write any Python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial

```diff
>>> print("Hello, World!")
```

## Python MySQL (Database)

To be able to experiment with the code examples in this tutorial, you should have MySQL installed on your computer.
You can download a MySQL database at https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.

### Connect the database as follows

- Install MySQL Driver
- Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database. In this tutorial, we will use the driver "MySQL Connector".
- We recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector".
- PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.

Navigate your command line to the location of PIP, and type the following-

### Download and install "MySQL Connector"

```diff
C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts>python -m pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### Create Connection

**_demo_mysql_connection.py_**

```diff
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  password="yourpassword"
)

print(mydb)
```
